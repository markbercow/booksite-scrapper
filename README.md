# Book Website Scraper

## Description and Initial Goals:

- To develop a simple webscraper that finds and cleans book data (demo datasite), then visualizes key insights  Â  

- Learn asyncio, and practice scraping with Beautiful Soup and mathlibplot

- Instrument using decorators to see performance differences

- Practice unit testing with pytest

## Skills and Tech Used:

- asyncio/aiohttp
- Beautiful Soup
- Pandas, matplotlib and Seaborn
- Time execution decorator
- Unit testing (pytest)

## Results and Key Learnings:

- The code works as desired. Implementing asyncio for the webpage fetches improved performance by more than 2x compared to interative fetches of each page. 

- This was a fun way to learn asyncio and aiohttp, and also how to unit test this approach

## Roadmap:

- Nothing else planned for this project.
